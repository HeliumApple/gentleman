annotation's projection does not display correctly if enabled from vanilla concept model

several hard-coded values(name of annotation concept and folders in the annotations folder)
    editor-core, editor-instance
fixed: name of annotation concept and the folders in the annotations folder are now defined in a json file
(models/annotations/inf.json)

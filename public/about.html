                        Various types of text editors exist to write software. The most popular is a plain text editor that highlights keywords and
                        proposes code completion depending on the context of the cursor. Programmers start with a blank page
                        and type in the code. This requires them to know in advance the structure of the code, as it is common
                        to all programs written in a programming language, like Java. However, when it comes to domain-specific
                        languages (DSL), users are typically not programmers. DSLs are small heavily constrained languages
                        that are tailored to a specific expertise. Starting from a blank page does not help them and not
                        seeing the overall structure is the source of lots of errors.
                    </p>

                        Projectional editors (PE) are an attractive solution because they prepopulate the structure of the code. PEs present text
                        and other visualizations, such as tables and equations, with placeholders. Users are only allowed
                        to write text in these placeholders, which reduces significantly the chances of making an error.
                        The editable parts of the code support advanced editing features, including syntax highlighting,
                        automatic text completion, and context-dependent suggestions.

                        The goal of this project is to implement the framework to automatically generate web-based PEs. The only input required is
                        the grammar of a DSL. In this project, the projectional editor generator should produce the editors
                        of two DSLs that will be integrated in the online software to conduct systematic literature reviews
                        we have been developing in our lab:
                        <em>
                            <a class="link link-out" href="http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~syriani/research_fr.html">ReLiS</a>
                        </em>. One editor is for a limited SQL to restrain queries to the database of a ReLiS project. It targets
                        users with programming experience. The other editor is for a DSL to configure projects in ReLiS.
                        It targets all users of ReLiS who are researchers in any domain.

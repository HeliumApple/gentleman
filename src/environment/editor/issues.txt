annotation's projection does not display correctly if enabled from vanilla concept model

several hard-coded values(name of annotation concept and folders in the annotations folder)
    editor-core, editor-instance

annotation languages loaded from the annotations folder are hard coded
    list of folders inside the "annotations" folder is hard-coded in editor-core and editor-instance

Config should be loaded from a function the same way the projections and models are is editor-core

annotation concepts does not allow a reference to any concept 
    Likely to be caused by the concept.json file

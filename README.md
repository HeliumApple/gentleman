[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geodes-sms/gentleman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geodes-sms/gentleman)

Gentleman aims to **to close the gap between models and domain experts**.

## Workflow

### **Design**

The *design* workflow includes every activity required to build an editor

- `[M]` Create a metamodel
- `[P]` Create projections
- `[E]` Configure the editor

### **Model**

The *model* workflow begins with every design artefacts (M.P.E.) in place

- `[m]` Create a model
- `[p]` Manipulate projections
- `[e]` Personnalize the editor

## Features

- Platform agnostic: Gentleman target the web (no installation required)
- Support textual and tabular notations and multimedia content
- Offer specialized UI units for projection layout and fields
- Integration with Ecore: Define an Ecore model and use it with Gentleman projections

### üëâ Demonstration

## Integration

### Decorate an HTML Tag

```html
<html>
    <body>
        ...
        <div data-gentleman="editor"></div>
        ...
        <script src="gentleman.mod.js"></script>  <!-- optional -->
        <script src="gentleman.app.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Create an instance in JS

```javascript
const CONCEPT_MODEL = {JSON};
const PROJECTION_MODEL = {JSON}

var editor = Gentleman.createEdiotr();
editor.init(CONCEPT_MODEL, PROJECTION_MODEL)
```

## Editor

The editor configuration is done through a JSON file.
It can be used to define the style of the editor components and register actions that will be made available in the menu.

### Base config

- **name**: name of the editor
- **root**: list of concepts made available for direct instanciation
- **header**: header section config
  - **css**: css classes added to the header container
- **body**: body section config
  - **css**: css classes added to the body container
- **menu**: menu config
  - **actions**: list of actions available in the menu
    - **name**: name of the action.
    - **content**: content displayed in the menu
    - **downloadable**: flag to indicate whether the result is downloadable
    - **require**: list of resource dependancies
  - **css**: css classes added to the menu container

``` json
{
    "editor": {
        "name": "...",
        "root": ["..."],
        "header": {
            "css": ["..."]
        },
        "body": {
            "css": ["..."]
        },
        "menu": {
            "actions": [
                { "name": "...", "content": "...", "downloadable": true }
            ],
            "css": ["..."]
        }
    }
}

```

### Register actions

#### Declare action in the menu

``` json
{
    "menu": {
        "actions": [
            { "name": "...", "content": "...", "downloadable": true }
        ],
        "css": ["editor-menu"]
    }
}
```

#### Define a handler for the action

``` js
  const handler = {
      "preview-projection": function (target) {
        this.triggerEvent({ "name": "build-projection" }, (pmodel) => {
            ...
        });
    }
  }
```

## Concept

Gentleman defines a metamodel though concepts.

### Attributes

An attribute allows two concepts to communicate

### Properties

A property allows to define a value on a concept

## Projection

A projection is a representation of a concept that can be visualized and interacted with in the graphical user interface (GUI).
Multiple projections may be defined for a single concept so as to allow different representation and level of granularity.

> **Example**  
> Consider the concept `Person` with attributes such as `name`, `age`, `height`, `shape`, and `type`.  
To manipulate a collection of `Person`, a *Table* is a highly efficient notation to make changes, but does not offer
enough flexibility for viewing purposes. However, a *List* which is less rigid in both structure and presentation
fit perfectly with this scenario.  
Therefore, a good strategy would be to define a projection per use cases:  
**(1)** Edit a *Person* and view all their attributes `->` Table projection  
**(2)** Enumerate all the defined *Person* showing only their *name* `->` List projection

Every projection is a composition of *layout*, *field* and *static* elements; all rendered as HTML elements.
They can be customized, individually or globally, directly with *style* rules or though external *CSS*.

### Layout

A layout element is used to organize elements presented in the GUI.

#### WrapLayout

The *WrapLayout* is the simplest of all the layouts. It groups its child elements in a container.

- Properties
  - **Containerless** `[boolean]`: indicates whether the elements are rendered without a container

#### StackLayout

The *StackLayout* adds control over one dimension. It arranges its child elements on either a vertical or a horizontal axis.

- Properties
  - **Orientation** `[string={horizontal|vertical}]` (*required*): indicates which direction the *StackLayout* should stack its children.

#### FlexLayout

The *FlexLayout* adds flexibility to the *StackLayout*. It offers the ability to wrap its children.

- Properties
  - **Orientation** `[string={row|column}]` (*required*): indicates which direction the *FlexLayout* should arrange its children.
  - **Wrap** `boolean`: indicates whether a line can wrap its content on several lines.

#### TableLayout

The *TableLayout* adds control over two dimensions. It arranges its child elements on cells grouped in rows.

### Field

A field element is used to receive and process input and output.
Gentleman defines the following fields:

#### TextField

The *TextField* can capture key input.

- Potential targets
  - String concept
  - Number concept

#### BinaryField

The *BinaryField* can alternate between two states.

- Potential targets
  - Boolean concept
  - Derivative concept with restricted values (enum)

#### ChoiceField

The *ChoiceField* can group related choices.

- Potential targets
  - Prototype concept
  - Boolean concept
  - Derivative concept with restricted values (enum)

#### ListField

The *ListField* can manage a collection of element.

- Potential targets
  - Set concept

#### TableField

The *TableField* can manage tabular data.

- Potential targets
  - Set concept

### Static

A static element is used to present static content.

#### Text

The *Stactic text* is used to display textual content.

- Properties
  - **content** `[string]` (*required*): Defines how the text's content
  - **contentType** `[string={raw|html}]`: Defines how the content should be processed

#### Image

The *Stactic image* is used to display images.

- Properties
  - **url** `[string]` (*required*): Defines the image's url
  - **width** `[number]`: Defines the image width
  - **height** `[number]`: Defines the image height

#### Link

The *Stactic link* is used to display links.

- Properties
  - **content** `[set:element]` (*required*): Defines link's displayed content
  - **url** `[string]` (*required*): Defines the link's url
  - **urlType** `[string={link|email|phone}]`: Defines how the link should be processed

#### HTML

The *Stactic HTML* is used to insert HTML Templates declared on the page.

# Installation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Gentleman is not recommended to be used in production.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Building the Code

To build the code, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command to install the dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

### Development

When working on the code, execute the following command

```
$ npm run start
```

This will start a development server (*webpack-dev-server*) that provides live reloading.

### Production

To deploy the code or test in a production environment, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that you have updated [build file](scripts/build.js) with newly created css files
2. From the project folder, execute the following command to build the code for production

```
$ npm run build
```

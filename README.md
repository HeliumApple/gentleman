# Gentleman - A lightweight web-based projectional editor generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geodes-sms/gentleman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geodes-sms/gentleman)

Gentleman aims to **to close the gap between models and domain experts**.

## Workflow

### **Design**

The *design* workflow includes every activity required to build an editor

- `[M]` Create a metamodel
- `[P]` Create projections
- `[E]` Configure the editor

### **Model**

The *model* workflow begins with every design artefacts (M.P.E.) in place

- `[m]` Create a model
- `[p]` Manipulate projections
- `[e]` Personnalize the editor

## Features

- Platform agnostic: Gentleman target the web (no installation required)
- Support textual and tabular notations and multimedia content
- Offer specialized UI units for projection layout and fields
- Integration with Ecore: Define an Ecore model and use it with Gentleman projections

### üëâ Demonstration

Take a look at the [demonstration (MODELS 2020) and see the tool in action](https://youtu.be/wJ4hVZjmrv4).

## Integration

### Decorate an HTML Tag

```html
<html>
    <body>
        ...
        <div data-gentleman="editor"></div>
        ...
        <script src="gentleman.mod.js"></script>  <!-- optional -->
        <script src="gentleman.app.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Create an instance in JS

```javascript
const CONCEPT_MODEL = {JSON};
const PROJECTION_MODEL = {JSON}

var editor = Gentleman.createEdiotr();
editor.init(CONCEPT_MODEL, PROJECTION_MODEL)
```

# Documentation

## Editor

The editor configuration is done through a JSON file.
It can be used to define the style of the editor components and register actions that will be made available in the menu.

[Learn more](docs/editor.md)

## Concept

Gentleman defines a metamodel though concepts.

[Learn more](docs/concept.md)

## Projection

A projection is a representation of a concept that can be visualized and interacted with in the graphical user interface (GUI).
Multiple projections may be defined for a single concept so as to allow different representation and level of granularity.

[Learn more](docs/projection.md)

# Installation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Gentleman is not recommended to be used in production.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Building the Code

To build the code, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command to install the dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

### Development

When working on the code, execute the following command

```
$ npm run start
```

This will start a development server (*webpack-dev-server*) that provides live reloading.

### Production

To deploy the code or test in a production environment, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that you have updated [build file](scripts/build.js) with newly created css files
2. From the project folder, execute the following command to build the code for production

```
$ npm run build
```
